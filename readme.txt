This is a complete rework of the game lighting.
The look is as close as possible to vanilla while deeply rebalancing different aspects of each region/weather lighting.

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• The Witcher 3 v4.03 or newer
• Shared Imports (https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2110)

:: FEATURES Template::
The final goal of the mod is to tweak and correct each lighting configuratio file to match my vision and improve visually the game.
For now, and because it takes a lot of time to fine-tune every setting, some regions/weathers of the game are not modified yet.

Changelog:
4.0a:
• Preview version of the mod
• Incomplete (missing regions and weathers)
• Includes lighting modifications of:
• Toussaint sunny
• Toussaint cave
• Toussaint rainy
• Von everec manor exterior
• Cutscenes (outside of Toussaint)
• No man's land (swamp)
• Velen and Novigrad (almost entirely)
• White Orchard (partially)
• Skellige (almost entirely)
• WIP Kaer Mohren
• Custom interior lighting
• Custom shadowmap filtering

::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
• Nothing for now
